## Curate without losing projects

Stars are a personal library—but they vanish when creators delete repos or your account is rate limited. Gitea Mirror can automatically capture every starred repository into a dedicated Gitea organization, complete with issues and releases, so your inspiration lives on.

## Requirements

- Gitea Mirror up and running (Docker, LXC, or Helm)
- GitHub PAT for the account whose stars you want mirrored
- Destination Gitea with a personal organization ready (e.g. `stars`)
- Optional: DNS entry for the mirror so friends can browse the collection

## Step-by-step

### 1. Enable starred owner tracking

1. In the onboarding wizard (or later under **Settings → Owners**), add your GitHub username.
2. Enable the **Include starred repositories** toggle.
3. Set the destination in Gitea to a dedicated org, e.g. `stars-jamie`.

### 2. Categorize the collection

- Create sub-organizations in Gitea (e.g. `stars-iot`, `stars-ai`).
- Use Destination Overrides inside the dashboard to route specific stars into themed orgs.
- Tag repos in Gitea with labels like `language:rust`, `topic:homelab` for quick filtering.

### 3. Schedule incremental updates

- Set the star discovery interval to something light like `1h` so new stars import quickly.
- Use the **Starred sync window** (e.g. `00:00-00:30`) to avoid interfering with org backups.
- Turn on **Starred repo cleanup** if you want unstarred projects removed from the library.

### 4. Showcase the library

- Point a read-only Gitea user at the org so friends can browse without write access.
- Host the Gitea instance behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS, then link it on your blog.
- Export the repo list weekly and share it as a curated newsletter.

## Verify the collection works

1. Star a new repo on GitHub.
2. Wait for the star interval or click **Sync now** in the dashboard.
3. Confirm the repo appears in your `stars` org with issues/releases intact.
4. Unstar it on GitHub; if cleanup is enabled, confirm it disappears on the next sync.

## Nice-to-haves

- Add a `README.md` in the Gitea org homepage explaining your tagging rules.
- Pair with [Preserve GitHub History](../preserve-github-history/) so you keep metadata, not just code.
- Use the [Helm deployment](../deploy-with-helm-chart/) if you want the collection available inside your cluster.
