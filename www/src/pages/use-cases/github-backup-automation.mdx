# Automate GitHub Backups

## Why automation beats cron

Shell scripts and `git clone --mirror` jobs work until they don’t—usually when GitHub rotates tokens, repositories rename, or metadata gets missed. Gitea Mirror bundles scheduling, auto-discovery, and repository cleanup so your backups keep running while you sleep.

## Requirements

- Gitea Mirror deployment with outbound HTTPS access
- GitHub PAT + Gitea token stored in the UI or supplied via environment variables
- A monitoring target that can poll HTTP endpoints (Healthchecks.io, Uptime Kuma, Prometheus, etc.)

## Step-by-step

### 1. Enable automatic syncing

1. Go to **Configuration → Automation**.
2. Toggle **Automatic syncing** on and choose an interval that matches your recovery point objective (start with `30 minutes` for active teams, stretch to `12 hours` for archives).
3. Confirm the scheduler is running by checking the **Last sync** and **Next sync** timestamps in the Automation card.

### 2. Keep the repository list current

- In **Configuration → Connections**, click **Import GitHub Data** so the dashboard knows about every repository, organization, and star you selected.
- Enable **Mirror starred repositories** if you want personal favorites backed up, and set the **Starred repos organization** for tidy storage in Gitea.
- Use the inline destination editor on the **Repositories** page when you need a repo to land in a different Gitea organization.

### 3. Configure repository cleanup (optional)

- Still on **Configuration → Automation**, enable **Handle orphaned repositories automatically**.
- Leave the action on **Archive** to keep a read-only backup when a GitHub repo disappears, or switch to **Delete** if you require a strict mirror.
- Disable **Dry run** after your first test so the cleanup service can act on what it finds.

### 4. Monitor scheduler health

- Point your monitoring system at `http://<mirror-host>:4321/api/health` to track uptime.
- Review sync failures from the **Activity Log** page or export them via `/api/events` for long-term retention.
- Run `bun run manage-db check` during maintenance windows to verify background tasks, migrations, and queue state.

### 5. Harden credentials and runbooks

- Store GitHub and Gitea tokens via the Configuration UI—Gitea Mirror encrypts them at rest.
- Rotate tokens on a schedule and note expiry dates in your homelab runbook; the dashboard surfaces failures when credentials expire.
- Export the configuration JSON (`/api/export`) alongside your documentation so you can rebuild the mirror quickly if you need to redeploy.

## Validate automation

- Force a failure by temporarily revoking a PAT; the next scheduler run should flag the repository in the Activity Log. Restore the token and trigger **Sync now** to confirm recovery.
- Run `bun run manage-db check` (or the UI health check) to ensure migrations and tasks are clean.
- Export the repositories table or CSV download to confirm `Last mirrored` timestamps match your configured interval.

## Best practices

- Tune the sync interval to balance freshness with GitHub rate limits; most homelabs sit between 30 and 120 minutes.
- Start with the cleanup action set to **Archive** until you are confident you will not remove something you still need.
- Pair automation with the [Preserve GitHub History](../preserve-github-history/) playbook to maintain context, not just code.

## FAQ

### What replaces my cron scripts?

The built-in scheduler handles intervals, retries, and discovery. It also powers cleanup for deleted upstream repos (Archive/Delete) once enabled.

### How do I get alerts if backups fail?

Monitor `/api/health` with Healthchecks.io or Uptime Kuma and review the Activity Log. You can export failures via `/api/events` for centralized logging.

### Will new repositories be discovered automatically?

Yes. After importing your GitHub data once, the scheduler’s discovery step keeps the inventory updated and mirrors new repositories on the next run.
