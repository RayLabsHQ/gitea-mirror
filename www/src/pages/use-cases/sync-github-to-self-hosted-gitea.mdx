## Keep SaaS and self-hosted in lockstep

You may still collaborate on GitHub every day, yet want a LAN Gitea copy you control. Gitea Mirror bridges the two: it tracks owners, auto-discovers repos, mirrors metadata, and keeps a local instance only minutes behind upstream without hand-written cron jobs.

## Requirements

- Gitea Mirror deployed (Docker, Proxmox LXC, or Helm)
- GitHub PAT with `repo`, `read:org`, and `admin:org` scopes
- Gitea API token for the target account/org
- Stable connectivity between the mirror host and both GitHub + Gitea

## Step-by-step

### 1. Connect accounts in the admin wizard

1. Sign in at `http://<mirror-host>:4321`.
2. Open **Settings → Connections**.
3. Paste the GitHub PAT and choose the owners (user + orgs) you want mirrored.
4. Add your self-hosted Gitea URL and token; pick the destination org structure (typically **Preserve structure**).

### 2. Enable continuous discovery

- Go to **Settings → Mirror Options** and toggle **Auto-discovery**.
- Set the discovery interval (for example `15 minutes`) so new repositories, forks, and transfers sync automatically.
- Optionally add a "Starred" owner to pull in personal favorites alongside org repos.

### 3. Configure sync cadence

Decide how far behind GitHub the mirror can lag:

- Global interval: start with `15 minutes` for active projects.
- Use **Custom intervals** on specific orgs/repositories if you need faster mirrors (as low as 5 minutes).
- Set a quiet window (e.g. `01:00-05:00`) for heavy metadata pulls to avoid daytime throttling.

### 4. Mirror metadata and LFS

Under **Repository defaults**:

- Enable **Mirror metadata** so issues, labels, and milestones stay in sync.
- Enable **Mirror LFS** if your repos store binaries; confirm your Gitea instance has LFS enabled.
- Turn on **Delete missing** only if you want Gitea to remove repos when they disappear upstream.

### 5. Validate the local mirror

- Select a repo in the dashboard and click **Sync now**.
- In Gitea, verify commit history, tags, issues, and releases match GitHub.
- Run a quick diff: `git remote add gitea http://<gitea>/<owner>/<repo>.git && git fetch gitea` then `git log origin/main..gitea/main` — it should be empty.

## Monitoring & alerts

- Check the **Activity** page for failed runs; set up Healthchecks.io/webhooks on the `/api/health` endpoint.
- Enable email notifications so administrators learn about repeated failures or token expiry.
- Export `/api/repos/:id/logs` periodically to archive sync history alongside the repos themselves.

## Tips for smooth syncing

- Avoid running more than one mirror against the same Gitea target; let Gitea Mirror manage the schedule centrally.
- When restructuring orgs, pause auto-discovery, move repos in Gitea, then resume to prevent thrash.
- Rate limits cropping up? Move the mirror onto a different IP or configure GitHub fine-grained PATs per org.
