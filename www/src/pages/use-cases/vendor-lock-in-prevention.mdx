## Keep your exit hatch open

GitHub can change pricing, authentication rules, or terms without notice. With Gitea Mirror running, you always have a live copy of code and metadata inside infrastructure you control—so switching to self-hosted Gitea, Forgejo, or something else becomes a DNS change, not a fire drill.

## Requirements

- Production-ready Gitea instance (backed by your usual storage and TLS)
- Gitea Mirror configured with owner discovery and metadata sync
- Documentation of your current GitHub org structure (for validation)
- Optional: reverse proxy + SSO for a smooth cutover experience

## Step-by-step

### 1. Mirror everything continuously

- Add every GitHub organization you care about as an owner in Gitea Mirror.
- Enable **Preserve structure** so Gitea’s org layout matches GitHub.
- Turn on metadata + LFS mirroring to ensure issues, releases, and binaries are ready on day one.

### 2. Simulate a cutover

1. Pick a pilot team.
2. Ask them to work exclusively out of the Gitea mirror for a sprint.
3. Capture feedback about permissions, webhooks, CI integrations, and adjust.

### 3. Keep integrations dual-homed

- Point your CI (e.g. Woodpecker, Jenkins) at both GitHub and Gitea using mirrored tokens.
- Maintain matching webhook payloads so automation keeps running post-swap.
- Mirror secrets (deploy keys, bot accounts) into the Gitea org to remove blockers.

### 4. Document the flip procedure

- Write a runbook: DNS updates, webhook changes, `git remote set-url` commands.
- Version-control the document inside the mirror so updates stay in sync.
- Rehearse twice a year; include steps to roll back to GitHub if needed.

### 5. Watch for drift

- Review the Gitea mirror weekly for newly created repos, teams, or permissions.
- Parse the `/api/owners` endpoint to ensure auto-discovery still works.
- Set alerts on the mirror’s activity log so you catch sync failures quickly.

## Success criteria

- A developer can change their `origin` remote to Gitea and push without errors.
- CI pipelines succeed when pointed exclusively at the mirror.
- All active repos have synced within your SLA (for example, last run < 2 hours ago).
- The runbook includes contact info, rollback steps, and verification checklists.
