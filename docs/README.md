- **[ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](./ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)** ‚Äì Complete reference for every configuration flag supported by the app and Docker images.

### Reliability & recovery
- **[GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN.md](./GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN.md)** ‚Äì How signal handling, shutdown coordination, and job persistence work in v3.
- **[RECOVERY_IMPROVEMENTS.md](./RECOVERY_IMPROVEMENTS.md)** ‚Äì Deep dive into the startup recovery workflow and supporting scripts.

### Authentication
- **[SSO-OIDC-SETUP.md](./SSO-OIDC-SETUP.md)** ‚Äì Configure OIDC/SSO providers through the admin UI.
- **[SSO_TESTING.md](./SSO_TESTING.md)** ‚Äì Recipes for local and staging SSO testing (Google, Keycloak, mock providers).

If you are looking for customer-facing playbooks, see the MDX use cases under `www/src/pages/use-cases/`.

## Quick start for local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RayLabsHQ/gitea-mirror.git
cd gitea-mirror
bun run setup           # installs deps and seeds the SQLite DB
bun run dev             # starts the Astro/Bun app on http://localhost:4321
```

The first user you create locally becomes the administrator. All other configuration‚ÄîGitHub owners, Gitea targets, scheduling, cleanup‚Äîis done through the **Configuration** screen in the UI.
